# Discordio

A fully-featured, open-source and selfhostable discord bot.
Made with discord.js and Commando.

Voice module uses lavalink

https://discordio.netlify.app

### Running

The recommended way to run Discordio is via [Docker](https://docker.com)

```bash
docker run \
```

### Credits

Most of the ideas come from the [Carl-Bot](https://carl.gg) and [MEE6](https://meey.xyz)
You might ask, then why did I make this bot in the first place when it doesn't offer much more features than those above (though, hypixel, minecraft and covid modules are unique)? The answer is simple - they aren't open source.
